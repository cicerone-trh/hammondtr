					<h2><img class="circlePicture left" src="img/me.jpg" />Hello, I'm Tyler</h2>
					<p>I'm terrible at this even though I've done it a dozen times. I'm going to try to express me by expressing some things that I like: I like programming, I like video games, I like driving, and I like emailing people to tell them how much I like their work. When I say I like something, I mean I have a fairly deep passion for it. It's hard to share how I feel about these things, but I'll do my best.</p>
					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>First is the nebulous concept of programming. There are two aspects I can divide my passion into: the abstract, romantic notion of the undefinable limits of computers and the tangible, practical satisfaction of crafting something to accomplish a goal.</p>
					<p>There is nothing special about a Turing machine in itself. Computers are remarkable because of the human ability to abstract meaning. We set systems up to represent any process we can abstract and a computer can embody that. Further, the only things that 'exist' are relative abstractions that our mind creates. Because of this one to one relationship (reality abstraction : computer abstraction), the only limit to what can be done with a computer is the limits of our perception. Or, more eloquently, anything is possible with a machine that can process lists.</p>
					<p>But that's just the romantic part of programming that only rarely makes you swoon; that realization is a clear night, with a new moon in the country and the stars are so vivid you notice the Orion Nebula for the first time.</p>
					<p>The true romance is the practical nature of the beast: it is an opportunity to build something completely new out of nothing, to really test one's mental craftsmanship. Indeed, the sort of mental acrobatics required and the satisfaction of having built something that provides tangible results are what make the discipline so enticing. It is a modern-day artisanal profession: the languages and frameworks are the medium from which to shape a functional experience.</p>

				<!-- alright, plans for this section: 
					(x) When the Header is clicked on, only then is the iframe loaded
					(x) Add tabbed source files
					(x) Make it such that context links affect the contentWindow / scroll to the desired location

					(4) Create a function that takes (sourcefile, line-number), then loads the iframe there and scrolls it to the line
						- header should go to Program.cs + main
					(5) Don't let browser determine font - want to make sure it displays properly in all browsers
					(6) Expand functionality: take up 100% of body height, allow tabbing through files
					(7) Clean up explanation of the recursive function and add link
					(8) Write explanation of encapsulation and proper OO concepts
					(9) Fix spacing and make it look less cluttered

						<p>Following are some examples embodying my aptitude and ability. While most examples are of limited scope, I have both worked in a singular enterprise system hosted on SVN and I have worked with dozens of websites in the span of a week. These examples are used because they hopefully express a tacit understanding of many types of systems.</p>
						<p>I don't have large amounts of experience with the most popular frameworks -- i.e. AngularJS, Spring, Boost, etc. -- but I am certain I would pick them up very quickly once I started working with them.</p>

						<p>This is a solution to a programming challenge* offered by Yodle. The challenge asks you to write a program that sorts out a large number of Jugglers with various attributes and desires such that the best teams perform on the most suited Circuits.
						Or, you can see how I rephrased it in the comments: <span id="prob-link" class="frame-link">(Line 61)</span></p>
						<p>The key to the problem is the recursive method of sorting them: when a team is full, but you come across another Juggler that is better suited, you have to shuffle that displaced Juggler onto another team. And, that Juggler can displace another one and so on. Thus, a recursive function is the solution:</p>

					<h3 id="asm-link">Assembly, Computation, Low-level Logic</h3>
					<div id="asm" class="hidden">

						<span>[expand]</span>
						<p>Unfortuately, due to the nature of my employment during the time I was working with assembly, there is little source code that I solely authored and that I currently have on hand. Of the items I do have access to, the most complicated is still very simple.</p>
						<p>Still, I have included this section because I found assembly to be extremely enlightening. I think a stint in low-level C or asm is somewhat of a Pilgrimage all programmers should take. The implicit understanding of how code exists in memory and that it is indistinguishable from data alone is worth the undertaking. Of course, you could also learn this through Lisp, but I don't know, the logical respresentation of the processor, its registers, IO calls, etc makes it easy it understand.</p>
						<p>With assembly and my foray into SmallTalk, I could really understand the power of abstractions and the power of computation.</p>
						<p>This program is a calculator that takes inputs and determines the operation to perform. Because it operates on such a low level, there's no definitions of tokens and operations; it's wonderfully simple.</p>
