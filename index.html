					<h2>Welcome to my little online home,</h2>
					<p>Welcome to this developer's humble online home. I rejected the subsidized residences of facebook and the like and foolishly decided to stake out a place of my own.</p>
					<p>While very bare at the moment, I hope to come up with a nice way of presenting who I am as a person, and who I am as a machine (developer).</p>

				<div id="about-me" class="hidden">
					<h2><img class="circlePicture" src="img/me.jpg" />Hello, I'm Tyler</h2>
					<p>Whatup homies, let me tell you a bit about me, why I like programming, and why I like other things. And maybe NOT why I like other things, maybe just the other things I like. If you can't figure out why they're so great then that is okay, you can like other things!</p>
				</div>
				<div id="evaluable" class="hidden">
					<h2>// presents self as an evaluable construct</h2>
					<p>This will be a launching point for my cicerone service and an interim way of displaying a few choice examples of things.</p>


<p>First, I'd like to talk about this site a little bit. I decided to finally hack something together and decided it would be very simple. I wanted to make something without using any fancy front-end stuff; I understand that there are prettier, more impressive things, but I put this off long enough. If you delve into the source, keep in mind I was trying to have a bit of fun.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a web app called "Cicerone" that is a sort of personal historian. I feel like posting GitHub repositories is one way of expressing your ability, but it heavily relies on the reader to have understand the individual's tacit understanding. Plus, I want to be able to record little things, like working through an essay or maybe a framework without actually creating anything substantial enough to create a repository. When I have hacked together a decent enough prototype, I'll include a link.</p>

<p>Now, with that out of the way, I think the best thing to do is give a little history of the various things I've worked on.</p> 

<h3>Assembly  - HP Enterprise Services</h3>

<p>When I originally started my professional career my aspiration was to gain a gestalt understanding of computer programming. The first step was processors and assembly.</p>
