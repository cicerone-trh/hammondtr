					<h2><img class="circlePicture left" src="img/me.jpg" />Hello, I'm Tyler</h2>
					<p>I've written a  few "about me"s, but I really want this one to be good. I'm going to try to express me by expressing some things that I like: I like programming, I like video games, I like driving, and I like emailing people to tell them how much I like their work. When I say I like something, I mean I have a fairly deep passion for it. It's hard to share how I feel about these things, but I'll do my best. </p>
					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>There is a common thread between each of these subjects, and while hard to pinpoint exactly, I think it has to do with unlimited potential. The world of computer programming is limited only by the human mind's ability to abstract concepts, which coincidentally is the same limit to one's ability to percieve reality; effectively there is no real limit to what one can do with a machine that processes lists. </p>
					<p>But that's just the romantic part of programming that only rarely makes you swoon; that realization is a clear night, with a new moon in the country and the stars are so vivid you notice the Orion Nebula for the first time.</p>
					<p>The true romance is the practical nature of the beast: it is an opportunity to build something completely new out of nothing, to really test one's mental craftsmanship.  Indeed, the sort of mental acrobatics required and the satisfaction of having built something that provides tangible results are what make the discipline so enticing. It is a modern-day artisanal profession: the languages and frameworks are the medium from which to shape a functional experience.</p>

						<p>Following are some examples embodying my aptitude and ability. While most examples are of limited scope, I have both worked in a singular enterprise system hosted on SVN and I have worked with dozens of websites in the span of a week. These examples are used because they hopefully express a tacit understanding of many types of systems.</p>
						<p>I don't have large amounts of experience with the most popular frameworks -- i.e. AngularJS, Spring, Boost, etc. -- but I am certain I would pick them up very quickly once I started working with them.</p>

					<h3 id="oop-link">OOP & Recursion</h3>
					<div id="oop" class="hidden">
						<p>This is a solution to a programming challenge offered by Yodle. The challenge asks you to write a program that sorts out a large number of Jugglers with various attributes and desires such that the best teams perform on the most suited Circuits.
						Or, you can see how I rephrased it in the comments. <span id="prob-link">(Line 61)</span></p>
						<iframe src="resources/FestivalCoordinator.cs.html" id="juggleComment"></iframe>
						<span>[expand]</span>
						<p>The full problem can be found <a href="resources/JuggleFest.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
						<p>The key to the problem is the recursive method of sorting them: when a team is full, but you come across another Juggler that is better suited, you have to shuffle that displaced Juggler onto another team. And, that Juggler can displace another one and so on. Thus, a recursive function is the solution:</p>

					<h3 id="asm-link">Assembly, Computation, Low-level Logic</h3>
					<div id="asm" class="hidden">
						<iframe id="asm-source" src="resources/gtt0.asm.html"></iframe>
						<span>[expand]</span>
						<p>Unfortuately, due to the nature of my employment during the time I was working with assembly, there is little source code that I solely authored and that I currently have on hand. Of the items I do have access to, the most complicated is still very simple.</p>
						<p>Still, I have included this section because I found assembly to be extremely enlightening. I think a stint in low-level C or asm is somewhat of a Pilgrimage all programmers should take. The implicit understanding of how code exists in memory and that it is indistinguishable from data alone is worth the undertaking. Of course, you could also learn this through Lisp, but I don't know, the logical respresentation of the processor, its registers, IO calls, etc makes it easy it understand.</p>
						<p>With assembly and my foray into SmallTalk, I could really understand the power of abstractions and the power of computation.</p>
						<p>This program is a calculator that takes inputs and determines the operation to perform. Because it operates on such a low level, there's no definitions of tokens and operations; it's wonderfully simple.</p>
