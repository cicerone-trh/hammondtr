					<h2>Hello, I'm Tyler</h2>
					<p>I'm terrible at this even though I've done it a dozen times. I'm going to try to express me by expressing some things that I like: I like programming, I like video games, and I like driving (to name a few). When I say I like something, I mean I have a fairly deep passion for it. It's hard to share how I feel about these things, but I'll do my best.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="clear"></div>

					<h3 id="aprog-link">Programming</h3>
					<div id="about-programming" class="hidden">
					<!-- my heroes: Alan Turing, Alan Kay, John von Neumann; photos public domain, fair use or CC (alan kay:  -->
						<div class="circlePicture right"><img src="img/neumann.jpg" class="circlePicture right" alt="John von Neumann, master Abstractor" /></div>
						<p>First is the nebulous concept of programming. There are two aspects I can divide my passion into: the abstract, romantic notion of the undefinable limits of computers and the tangible, practical satisfaction of crafting something to accomplish a goal.</p>
						<p>There is nothing special about a Turing machine in itself. Computers are remarkable because of the human ability to abstract meaning. We set systems up to represent any process we can abstract and a computer can embody that. Further, the only things that 'exist' are relative abstractions that our mind creates. Because of this one to one relationship (reality abstraction : computer abstraction), the only limit to what can be done with a computer is the limits of our perception. Or, more eloquently, anything is possible with a machine that can process lists.</p>
						<p>Another way to put it is: everything we know about the world is a model. Computers can embody any model we imagine. Thus, computers are capable of anything.</p>
						<p>But that's just the romantic part of programming that only rarely makes you swoon; that realization is a clear night, with a new moon in the country and the stars are so vivid you notice the Orion Nebula for the first time.</p>
						<div class="clear"></div>
						<div class="circlePicture left"><img src="img/alan_kay.jpg" class="circlePicture left" alt="Alan Kay, human-computer Champion" /></div>
						<p>The true romance is the practical nature of the beast: it is an opportunity to build something completely new out of nothing, to really test one's mental craftsmanship. Indeed, the sort of mental acrobatics required and the satisfaction of having built something that provides tangible results are what make the discipline so enticing. It is a modern-day artisanal profession: the languages and frameworks are the medium from which to shape a functional experience.</p>
						<p>It's the satisfaction of getting something working just like you wanted it to, when the pieces all come together and you just want to play with it.</p>
					</div>

					<h3 id="agame-link">Video Games</h3>
					<div id="about-games" class="hidden">
						<p>I like video games of all types, but the ones I'm most absorbed with are competitive. If <span>Thomas Was Alone</span> is the occassional dessert, <span>Dota 2</span> is a basic meal.</p>
						<p>Dota 2 is a complex system that professionals spend thousands of hours understanding. Because of its complexity, there is an astounding difference in understanding between me and a professional. Thus, almost every game there's something new to learn and something to be awed by.</p>
						<p>Like a mental version of parkour: the simply stated goal is to get from point a to b as efficiently as possible, but the system of their movement is remarkable;  it's revolutionary compared to your current understanding of how to get from point a to point b. It's inspiring to always be in awe of the capabilities of humanity.</p>
						<p>While the most stimulating part is the macro strategy, the micro can be pretty spectacular too. This clip still gives me goosebumps ^_^</p>
						<p>Embedding youtube was calling many external "anti-bot" scripts, so for now I am only linking, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9WPOOuyb5I8" target="_blank">enjoy :)</a></p>

					<div id="about-driving" class="hidden">
						<div class="circlePicture left"><img src="img/dailydriver.jpg" class="circlePicture left" alt="My daily driver, S2000 AP2" /></div>
						<p>Driving is perhaps the least suited of these passions to express via text. You just have to live it and understand it; there's nothing quite like going fast. It's thrilling and it's incredibly easy to get into flow identifying the limit of your vehicle as you take a turn. </p>
						<p>But that's only one variant of driving. Another variant of driving would be dirt bikes. This is even harder to express via text, because far fewer people have the experience to build on.</p>
						<p>When you drive a car, there's subconsciously a room around you: you are closed off from your environment. When you're on a motorcycle, you're almost completely exposed to the world. Because of this, you get a real sense of "going" somewhere. I tried to explain this to a friend by saying, "cars are like teleporting but very slow, while bikes are like walking but very fast". Also, you have all the potential thrill from driving a car and melding with the machine.</p>
						<div class="clear"></div>
						<div class="circlePicture right"><img class="circlePicture right" src="img/adventure.jpg" alt="Dirt Biking" /></div>
						<p>Combine this with outdoors exploring, and you have an incredibly rich experience.</p>

						<p>Following are some examples embodying my aptitude and ability. While most examples are of limited scope, I have both worked in a singular enterprise system hosted on SVN and I have worked with dozens of websites in the span of a week. These examples are used because they hopefully express a tacit understanding of many types of systems.</p>
						<p>I don't have large amounts of experience with the most popular frameworks -- i.e. AngularJS, Spring, Boost, etc. -- but I am certain I would pick them up very quickly once I started working with them.</p>

					<div id="code-explain">
						<p>This is a solution to a programming challenge<a target="_blank" href="resources/JuggleFest.html">*</a> offered by Yodle. In short, the challenge asks you to write a program that sorts out a large number of Jugglers based on various attributes and desires such that the best teams perform on their most desired Circuits. Or, you can see how I rephrased it in the comments: <span id="prob-link" class="frame-link">(FestivalCoordinator, Line 53)</span></p>
						<p>As previously stated, these examples are of limited scope. If this program used polymorphic behaviors on inherited classes it would be overly complex. Example, the Coordinator could operate on a "person" and "juggler" could be a type of person, but that's pointlessly complex (and definitely not agile). </p>
						<p>That said, because of proper encapsulation and sensible object divisions, it would be fairly easy to change this functionality. Maybe the Coordinator has to coordinate "Jugglers" and "Bowlers", in that case it might be better to have an "Athlete" class; you wouldn't need to change the function names from Juggler, and thus the Coordinator wouldn't have to change very much.</p>
						<p>Next, the key to solving the sorting problem is recursion: when a team is full, but you come across another Juggler that is better suited, you have to shuffle that displaced Juggler onto another team. That Juggler can displace another and so on. Thus, a recursive function is the solution: <span id="recursive-link" class="frame-link">(FestivalCoordinator, line 112)</span></p>

						<div class="mobile">
							<p><span>To view code, rotate your device :)</span></p>
						</div>
						<iframe class="desktop" id="asm-source"></iframe>
						<p>Unfortuately, due to the nature of my employment during the time I was working with assembly, there is little source code that I solely authored and that I currently have on hand. Of the items I do have access to, the most complicated is still very simple.</p>
						<p>Still, I have included this section because I found assembly to be extremely enlightening. I think a stint in low-level C or asm is somewhat of a pilgrimage all programmers should take. The implicit understanding of how code exists in memory and that it is indistinguishable from data alone is worth the undertaking. Of course, you could also learn this through Lisp, but I don't know, the logical respresentation of the processor, its registers, IO calls, etc makes it easy it understand.</p>
						<p>With assembly and my foray into SmallTalk, I could really understand the power of abstractions and the power of computation.</p>
						<p>This program is a calculator that takes inputs and determines the operation to perform. Because it operates on such a low level, there's no definitions of tokens and operations; it's wonderfully simple.</p>

								<p>I've done quite a lot of work in a LAMP environment. I have worked with WordPress, PyroCMS, Joomla and proprietary, in-house CMS products. Additionally, I have written PHP modules and applications entirely from scratch. That said, I am always interested in other web development methodologies. *Eyeing <a href="http://www.seaside.st/" target="_blank">seaside.st</a>*</p>

								<h4>hammondtr.net - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cicerone-trh/hammondtr">github</a></h4>
								<p>This site is 100% front-end and all running code can be found through view source. It is animated with a combination of jQuery and CSS3. While I understand people generally prefer to scroll rather than to click, I personally enjoy clicking buttons. If you prefer a scrolling site, check back in like.. a year. A redesign that's scrolly and fully responsive is on my list of projects.</p>
								<p>My favorite part is the code window and its navigation. It is implemented with an iframe and html files generated with VIM's :tohtml function. In order to manipulate the iframe I've written a function "setSourceWindow" that takes an iframe element, a uri, and an optional integer as arguments. </p>
								<p>The function creates a jQuery selector for the line-number, loads the resource if needed, and then uses a jQuery function to scroll the page to the selector. It's simple, but I really like the effect.</p>

								<h4>Ambler Architects - <a target="_blank" href="http://staging.amblerarchitects.com/">staging.amblerarchitects.com</a></h4>
								<p>This site is what I'd call a 'regular site', I wrote the front-end and implemented the PyroCMS back-end. It has multiple pages of content, including a portfolio section, and it uses a CMS to allow non-technical users to edit this content. </p>
								<p>I have just checked this site and it is not displaying properly on Linux/MacOS browsers. The issue is that the CSS framework being used addresses whitespace between “stacked” inline-block elements by applying a negative margin equal to the width of the parent font's whitespace. The source of the original font has expired, and it has now fallen back to browser default, which on certain machines has a 1px wider whitespace. This could have been avoided by specifying an alternate font, but when implementing the site, I was told to use only the one selected.</p>

								<h4>Cicerone: Personal Historian - <a target="_blank" href="https://cicph.info/">cicph.info</a></h4>
								<p>This is a personal project I wrote to keep track of my time spent on projects. It is a fairly simple site. I log activities which belong to projects which belong to users. It is meant to help embody and track constructionist learning. I enjoy using it, anyway :)</p>
								<p>As I use the site more, I will update it to include useful features. I have a few plans already, but they are still in the design phase.</p>
								<p>The github repo for it can be found at <a href="https://github.com/cicerone-trh/cicerone" target="_blank">github.com/cicerone-trh/cicerone</a>.</p>
