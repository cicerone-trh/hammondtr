				<p>Welcome to this developer's humble online home. I rejected the subsidized residences of facebook and the like and foolishly decided to stake out a place of my own.</p>
				<p>While very bare at the moment, I hope to come up with a nice way of presenting who I am as a person, and who I am as a machine (developer).</p>
			</div>
			<div id="about-me" class="hidden">
				<p>Whatup homies, let me tell you a bit about me, why I like programming, and why I like other things. And maybe NOT why I like other things, maybe just the other things I like. If you can't figure out why they're so great then that is okay, you can like other things!</p>
			</div>
			<div id="evaluable" class="hidden">
				<p>This will be a launching point for my cicerone service and an interim way of displaying a few choice examples of things.</p>
