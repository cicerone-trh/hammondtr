					<h2>Welcome to my little online home,</h2>
					<p>Welcome to this developer's humble online home. I rejected the subsidized residences of facebook and the like and foolishly decided to stake out a place of my own.</p>

I wanted to make something without using any fancy front-end stuff; I understand that there are prettier, more impressive things, but I put this off long enough. If you delve into the source, keep in mind I was trying to have a bit of fun.</p>



<h3>Objected Oriented Programming and Recursion</h3>

<p>This is a solution to a programming challenge offered by Yodle. The challenge asks you to write a program that sorts out a large number of Jugglers who have various attributes such that the best teams perform on the most suited Circuits.</p>

<p>The full problem can be found <a href="resources/JuggleFest.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The key to the problem is the recursive method of sorting them:</p>

<p>When I originally started my professional career my aspiration was to gain a gestalt understanding of computer programming. The first step was processors and assembly.</p>
